Custom Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG) Test
This repository contains a custom-built Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG) implemented in Python. The project is part of the coursework for Cryptography and Cyber Law, demonstrating PRNG design, uniformity testing, and dependency analysis.

🔍 Objective
To design and evaluate a simple PRNG using a mathematical algorithm and analyze:

Uniformity of generated numbers
Statistical dependency between consecutive values
🧠 PRNG Algorithm Used
The generator uses a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) algorithm with the formula:

X(n+1) = (a * Xn + c) mod m

Where:

a = 1664525 (multiplier)
c = 1013904223 (increment)
m = 2^32 (modulus)
X0 = seed (initial value)
These are commonly used parameters that offer reasonable randomness for academic experiments.

📊 Analysis and Plots
The notebook performs:

✅ 1. Uniformity Test
A histogram shows that values are spread uniformly between [0, 1].

✅ 2. Dependency Test
A scatter plot of X(n) vs X(n+1) reveals the deterministic nature of the generator and possible patterns.

✅ 3. Comparison with NumPy
A visual comparison with Python’s numpy.random module highlights the differences in statistical quality.

✅ Conclusion This project demonstrates how a simple algorithm like LCG can generate pseudorandom sequences, and how statistical tests can uncover the generator’s limitations. It's a great way to understand the strengths and weaknesses of non-cryptographic PRNGs.
